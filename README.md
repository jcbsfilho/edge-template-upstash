## **6. Create the Pull Request for automatic deployment**

Create the develop branch, make a change and then create the Pull Request for the main branch.

```bash

git checkout -b develop

```

Change Here!!!

```js

const name = 'your name' // change here you name

```

Commit change and push!

```bash

git add README.md
git commit -m "feat: test update to deploy"
git push --set-upstream origin develop

```

Create a pull request to the main branch to automatically deploy.

How create [Create Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/pt/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

## **7. Automated config**

In the Actions file (workflows) [main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml) the step of automating changes in the first build.

The build Action performs a change the first time in the [./azion/azion.json](./azion/azion.json) file, updating the resource id's.

*Change may be required if your main branch is protected*


## **8. Enable feature Application Acceleration**

If your deploy is successful!!! 

Enter the Edge Application menu on your RTM, look for your sample application and in Main Settings activate the Application Acceleration.

*Enable Application Acceleration to this site to use advanced rules engine, advanced cache key, bypass cache, forward cookies or support to proxy methods (post/put/patch/delete).*
